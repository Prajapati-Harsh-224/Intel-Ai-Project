## ▶️ Running the App

Use the following command to launch the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🖼️ How to Use

1. **Login** or **Sign Up** with your credentials.
2. **Upload an image OR zip file** of a steel strip.
3. The model will detect and classify the defect (if any).
4. You can **view your prediction history** from the sidebar.
5. **Export results as a PDF** for record-keeping.
